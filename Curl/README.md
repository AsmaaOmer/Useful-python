## Curl
* https://curl.haxx.se/

## Usage
Give execute permission to your script:
`chmod +x /path/to/yourscript.sh`

And to run your script:
`/path/to/yourscript.sh`

Since `.` refers to the current directory: if `yourscript.sh` is in the current directory, you can simplify this to:

`./yourscript.sh`
