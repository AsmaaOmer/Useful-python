## SQL cheat sheet
* Just see http://g2pc1.bu.edu/~qzpeng/manual/MySQL%20Commands.htm

## Optimising queries
* https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql/relational-queries-in-sql/a/more-efficient-sql-with-query-planning-and-optimization
* [See the sqlite docs](https://www.sqlite.org/queryplanner.html)

## DB normalisation
* [Read](http://joshualande.com/database-normalization)
* TLDR: process of designing a db so that data appears in one place only, with info in different tables linked by unique ID. Allows horizontal scalability and reduces risk of errors, and allows efficient queries.
