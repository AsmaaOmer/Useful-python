## CausalNex - Causal Inference with Bayesian Networks
* https://causalnex.readthedocs.io
* CausalNex is a python library that allows data scientists and domain experts to co-develop models which go beyond correlation to consider causal relationships.

* Bayesian Networks (BNs) are probabilistic graphical models that represent the dependency structure of a set of variables and their joint distribution efficiently in a factorised way. BNs are able to capture complex relationships between variables and represent dependencies between drivers and include drivers that do not affect the target directly.
