## Socket.io
* Socket.IO is a transport protocol that enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication between clients (typically, though not always, web browsers) and a server. The official implementations of the client and server components are written in JavaScript. [python-socketio](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/python-socketio/) provides Python implementations of both, each with standard and asyncio variants.
