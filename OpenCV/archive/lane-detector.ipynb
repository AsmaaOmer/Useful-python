    "### Approach 1: Hough Transform\n",
    "Uur intuitive first approach may be to first detect prominent straight lines in the camera feed through edge detection and feature extraction techniques -> this method would break instantly on curved lanes or sharp turns.\n",

    "## Approach 2: Spatial CNN\n",
    "To address this issue, Spatial CNN (SCNN) proposes an architecture which “generalizes traditional deep layer-by-layer convolutions to slice-by slice convolutions within feature maps”. What does this mean? In a traditional layer-by-layer CNN, each convolution layer receives input from its preceding layer, applies convolutions and nonlinear activation, and sends the output to the succeeding layer. SCNN takes this a step further by treating individual feature map rows and columns as the “layers”, applying the same process sequentially (where sequentially means that a slice passes information to the succeeding slice only after it has received information from the preceding slices), allowing message passing of pixel information between neurons within the same layer, effectively increasing emphasis on spatial information."
