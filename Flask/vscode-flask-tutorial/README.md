Intros templates: 
* A template is an HTML file that contains placeholders for values that the code provides at run time. The templating engine takes care of making the substitutions when rendering the page. The code, therefore, concerns itself only with data values and the template concerns itself only with markup.
* The default templating engine for Flask is Jinja, which is installed automatically when you install Flask. This engine provides flexible options including automatic escaping (to prevent XSS attacks) and template inheritance. With inheritance, you can define a base page with common markup and then build upon that base with page-specific additions.
