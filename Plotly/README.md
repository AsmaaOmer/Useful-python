* API key required
* When we make a plotly graph, itâ€™s published online by default which makes sharing visualizations easy -> https://plot.ly/feed/#/
* You will need to create a free plotly account which gives you 25 public charts and 1 private chart.
* For intro see https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-interactive-time-series-visualizations-with-plotly-in-python-d3219eb7a7af
* Online chart editor to improve look of plots
* Investigate if interactive plots are required -> simpler API than Bokeh is the promise.
