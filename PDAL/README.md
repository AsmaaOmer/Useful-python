#Â PDAL
* https://pdal.io/
* C++ tools for manipulating point cloud data, similar to GDAL
* PDAL provides a suite of command-line applications that users can conveniently use to process, filter, translate, and query point cloud data.
* PDAL provides [Python support](https://pdal.io/python.html#python) in two significant ways. First it embeds Python to allow you to write Python programs that interact with data using filters.python filter. Second, it extends Python by providing an extension that Python programmers can use to leverage PDAL capabilities in their own applications.
* PDAL Python bindings require a working PDAL install (PDAL) and then installation of the Python extension. `pip install PDAL`

## PDAL Docker
* PDAL itself is a pain to build, so [use Docker to get started quickly](https://pdal.io/quickstart.html#docker)
* https://hub.docker.com/r/pdal/pdal/
* `docker pull pdal/pdal`
