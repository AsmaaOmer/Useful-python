* Orfeo ToolBox is an open-source project for state-of-the-art remote sensing, including a fast image viewer, apps callable from Bash, Python or QGIS, and a powerful C++ API.
* Python 2 required, for setup script required to set `export OTB_PYTHON_EXE=/usr/bin/python` then follow [these instructions](https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/CookBook/Installation.html#macos-x)
* [Deep learning module](https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/a-remote-module-for-deep-learning/)


### Moneverdi
[Monteverdi](https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/CookBook/Monteverdi.html) is a satellite image viewer. Its main features are:

* Performance: Navigate instantly in full size satellite images thanks to its hardware accelerated rendering engine. Compose tiles or compare multiple images in a stack with rapid cycling and shader effects.
* Sensor geometry support: View raw images directly in sensor geometry! Resampling is handled by the GPU through texture mapping. OTB automagically handles coordinates mapping between actors and viewport geometries.
* Powerful: Access to all processing application from OTB. Orthorectification, optical calibration, classification, SAR processing, and much more!
