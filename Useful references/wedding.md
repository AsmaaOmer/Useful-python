VENUE

The castle is located in the centre of the small town of  Sannidandro di Bari, 15 mins drive away from Bari (Puglia).

History

The castle was built as a fortification by order of Emperor Constantine VII  to defend against Saracen attacks. The castle has served  many purposes starting in the Middle Ages (fortress purposes) to the federician age (residential purposes), in fact you can still see two distinct parts in the castle, the Byzantines area and the Swabians's part.

The castle is surrounded by a road which runs on the ancient moat, in the beginning the fortress had eight towers of which only six survive nowadays. However you can still see two beautiful giant portals still preserved since the Byzantines era from which you can spot the holes for the chains of the drawbridge. You will also note on the portals top edge the Grimaldi family's coat of arms, family whom held power in the town for decades in the 1600.
 In 1800 the castle was used to raise funds for the maintenance of San Nicholas's Basilica in Bari and only in 1900 Sannicandro town hall purchased the castle and the restoration of the fortress began.

It's now used for national and international conferences and private celebrations.
