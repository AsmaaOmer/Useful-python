LOCATION AND WEDDING VENUE
The venue for the wedding is the castle in Marias home-town of Sannicandro. The town is located 15 minutes drive from Bari, which is the regional capital of Puglia. The region is very popular with tourists due to its beautiful beaches, high quality food and rich history. To read more about Puglia, check Puglia by Lonely Planet.

FLIGHTS
The easiest way to get to Bari is by plane, and during the summer there are direct flights from London with British Airways, Ryanair, EasyJet and Whizzair. Flight time is approximately 2.5 hours and costs range from £50 to £150 return. We recommend you fly on Saturday the 29th of September so you can settle into your accommodation prior to the wedding on the 30th. Please visit Skyscanner.com to check flights timetables.

LOCAL TRANSPORT
A cab from the airpot to Sannidandro should cost around XX euros. Public transport is very infrequent, so we recommend you rent a car if you plan on travelling around the region. Please visit Rentcar.com for more information.

CASTLE HISTORY
Construction of the castle began in 916 on the orders of the Byzantine general Niccolò Piccingli, in order to defend the area against Saracen attacks. During the Houhenstaufen period around 1240 it was converted to a fortified residential castle, with large windows and an escape tunnel added. During the 1800's the castle fell into disrepair, but in 1900 Sannicandro town hall purchased the castle and restoration began. The castle is now used for national and international conferences, as well as private functions.
