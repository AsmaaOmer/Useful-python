## Lean Algorithmic Trading Engine
* https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean
* Lean Engine is an open-source algorithmic trading engine built for easy strategy research, backtesting and live trading. We integrate with common data providers and brokerages so you can quickly deploy algorithmic trading strategies.
* The core of the LEAN Engine is written in C#; but it operates seamlessly on Linux, Mac and Windows operating systems. It supports algorithms written in Python 3.6, C# or F#. Lean drives the web based algorithmic trading platform QuantConnect.
* Appears to require an `.exe`.. and Visual Studio?
* Using the online IDE a number of [packages are available](https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/key-concepts/supported-libraries#Supported-Libraries-Library-List)
