## Pytorch
* https://pytorch.org/
* Python interface, but also has a C++ interface
* PyTorch provides two high-level features: (1) Tensor computing (like NumPy) with strong acceleration via graphics processing units (GPU). (2) Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autodiff system
* Notebook tutorials on https://notebooks.azure.com/pytorch but note that many of the examples require you to download data but do not provide the links to the data
