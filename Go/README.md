## Golang - 'Go'
* Used server side, very scalable & fast. 
* Example use case -> create ML model in python, [serve with Go](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_go)
* [Go for python devs](https://golang-for-python-programmers.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [Moving from Python to Go](https://towardsdatascience.com/moving-to-go-from-python-9ebbd9a8aec4)
* [Go kernel for Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/gopherdata/gophernotes) -> had to add to the path manually `export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin`. See my issue [here](https://github.com/gopherdata/gophernotes/issues/162).
* To use packages from github, it is necessary to (1) `go get {package}`, (2) `go build`, and (3)`go install`
