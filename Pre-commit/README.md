## Pre-commit hooks
* `pip install pre-commit`
* https://pre-commit.com/
* Git hook scripts are useful for identifying simple issues before submission to code review. We run our hooks on every commit to automatically point out issues in code such as missing semicolons, trailing whitespace, and debug statements.
