### Comments from Moses at deepstack
On the business model, our current plan is to provide a basic free version with preloaded models, while there will be an enterprise version with features like:

- Adding custom models and creating new API endpoints 
- Robust admin dashboard with analytics features 
- Robust security options 
- Frequent updates 
- Extra pre-built models with wider recognition capabilities and applications.

DeepStack is is built on Docker. Docker is available on Windows, Linux and cloud services like AWS and Azure . All you need is spin up a virtual machine, install Docker on the machine, then install DeepStack and your virtual machine becomes your self-managed cognitive API cloud...  With Zero API costs.

The enterprise version is planned to be subscription based.

We are working on the lightweight version, especially because of IoT applications and other embedded devices. We will release this version before the 1St Quarter of 2019 runs out.
