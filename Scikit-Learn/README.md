* The essential building blocks for ML

## auto-sklearn
* https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/master/
* `auto-sklearn` frees a machine learning user from algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning. It leverages recent advantages in Bayesian optimization, meta-learning and ensemble construction.
* `auto-sklearn` is completely automatic and black-box. It searches a vast space of models and constructs complex ensemles of high accuracy, taking a substantial amount of computation and time in the process. The goal of auto-sklearn is to build the best model possible given the data.
