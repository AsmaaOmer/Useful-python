## Support Vector Machines

* Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection.
* Super Vector Machines (SVMs) were first introduced in 1992. This is a training algorithm for data classification, which maximizes the margin between the training examples and the class boundary. The SVM learns a hyperplane which separates
instances from multiple activity classes with maximum margin. Each training data instance should contain one class label and several features. The goal of a SVM is to generate a hyperplane which provides a class label for each data point described by a set of feature values.
