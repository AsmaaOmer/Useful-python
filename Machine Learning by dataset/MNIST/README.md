## MNIST

The MNIST dataset is a classic dataset in the machine learning community, which has been around for almost as long as the field itself and has been very intensively studied. It's a set of 60,000 training images, plus 10,000 test
images, assembled by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (the NIST in MNIST) in the 1980s.
