## Data detective
* Some background work to https://github.com/robmarkcole/HASS-data-detective
* Correlation: use case is for identifying strongly correlated sensors - can use for dimensionality reduction, e.g. by displaying only a single aggregate sensor
* Data mining: use Prophet to uncover seasonal behaviour and trends, e.g. we are doing more washing than this time last year
* Anomaly detection, e.g. water leaks
* Clustering: can we identify clusters of sensor states that have some meaning e.g. in bed sensor
* Bayesian sensor: can we determine the right combo of inputs and priors
