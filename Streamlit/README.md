* Streamlit is a Python app framework built specifically for Machine Learning and Data Science teams. Install Streamlit, import it, write a few lines of code, and run your script. Streamlit watches for changes on each save and updates automatically, visualizing your output while you’re coding. Code runs from top to bottom, always from a clean state, and with no need for callbacks. It’s a simple and powerful app model that lets you build rich UIs incredibly quickly.
