* Dask is a flexible library for parallel computing in Python. Dask represents parallel computations with task graphs. These directed acyclic graphs may have arbitrary structure, which enables both developers and users the freedom to build sophisticated algorithms and to handle messy situations not easily managed by the map/filter/groupby paradigm common in most data engineering frameworks.
