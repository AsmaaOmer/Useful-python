## Naïve Bayes
* https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html
* Naive Bayes methods are a set of supervised learning algorithms, which only require a small amount of training data and can be extremely fast compared to more sophisticated methods.
* A naïve Bayes Classifier is a simple probabilistic classifier
that assumes the presence of a particular feature of a class is
unrelated to any other features. It applies Bayes’ theorem to learn
a mapping from the features to a classification label. Despite its naïve design and over-simplified assumptions, the naïve Bayes classifier often works more effectively in many complex real world situations than other classifiers. It only requires a small amount of training data to estimate the parameters needed for classification.
