## TFlite
* Tflite is an alternative interpreter that requires optimised models, read -> https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide
* To quickly start executing TensorFlow Lite models with Python, you can install just the TensorFlow Lite interpreter, instead of all TensorFlow packages. This interpreter-only package is a fraction the size of the full TensorFlow package and includes the bare minimum code required to run inferences with TensorFlow Lite
