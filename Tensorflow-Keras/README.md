* TensorFlow2 is changing the way to code machine learning models to be more pythonic. Debugging and creating models were complicated with sessions and graphs but not anymore. Eager Execution allows evaluating tensors on the fly without having to run a session to execute code from end to end. Now, TensorFlow 2.0 introduces eager execution by default.

## Tensorflow probability
* TensorFlow Probability (TFP) is a Python library built on TensorFlow that makes it easy to combine probabilistic models and deep learning on modern hardware (TPU, GPU). It's for data scientists, statisticians, ML researchers, and practitioners who want to encode domain knowledge to understand data and make predictions.
