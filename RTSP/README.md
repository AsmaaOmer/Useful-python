## RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol)
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Streaming_Protocol
* [openRTSP](http://www.live555.com/openRTSP/) -> a command-line program that can be used to open, stream, receive, and (optionally) record media streams that are specified by a RTSP URL - i.e., an URL that begins with `rtsp://` (`brew install openRTSP`)
* [RTSP Client for Python](https://github.com/statueofmike/rtsp)
* RTSP streams can be viewed using VLC, or I have the IP Camera MacOS app
* Can also use ffmpeg (preferred solution using https://github.com/kkroening/ffmpeg-python)
