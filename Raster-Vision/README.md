* Python framework for building computer vision models on satellite, aerial, and other large imagery sets (including oblique drone imagery).
* Experiments can be executed on CPUs and GPUs with built-in support for running in the cloud using AWS Batch -> https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision-aws
* The framework is extensible to new data sources, tasks (eg. object detection), backends (eg. * TF Object Detection API), and cloud providers.
* Start with [the examples](https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision-examples)
