## Microsoft
I use OneNote daily, Excel quite often for sharing data and basic analytics. Microsoft Azure is one of the 3 main choices for cloud computing. I am familiar with Azure Jupyter notebooks, but otherwise not familiar with the Azure stack. Other notable products include their business reporting tooles, e.g. [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/report-server/)
