## Fast.ai course v3
* TLDR: deep learning course using the [fastai](https://docs.fast.ai/) package
* [Course website](https://course.fast.ai/)
* [Lesson wiki](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/Main_Page) & [forums](https://forums.fast.ai/)
* Free GPU -> Colab (not always available)
* Paid GPU -> They appear to be pushing Paperspace hardest

## Colab
* Free GPU (shared), but some setup of the env required for each notebook, and need to make data available.
* [Getting started with Colab and fast.ai](https://course-v3.fast.ai/start_colab.html) -> a little bit of prep is required before using each notebook. Use the Github repo to get the latest course notebooks entering the source repo as `fastai/course-v3` and in the first cell of a notebook run `!curl https://course-v3.fast.ai/setup/colab | bash`
